# dopArchitecton: A Practical Collection of Backend Architectures

![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/popalopaopa/dopArchitecton.svg)

## Overview

Welcome to **dopArchitecton**! This repository offers a practical collection of backend architectures, ranging from monolithic to event-driven designs. It serves as a valuable resource for learning, demonstration, and the technical evolution of real-world projects. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you will find modular, scalable architectures ideal for studies, Proof of Concepts (PoCs), and best practices.

## Features

- **Diverse Architectures**: Explore various backend architectures.
- **Modular Design**: Each architecture is designed to be modular for easy understanding and implementation.
- **Scalability**: Built to scale as your projects grow.
- **Best Practices**: Learn and implement industry best practices.
- **Hands-On Learning**: Engage with practical examples for real-world applications.

## Architectures Included

This repository features a variety of backend architectures, including:

- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single-tiered software application where all components are interconnected and interdependent.
  
- **Microservices Architecture**: A design that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific business capability.
  
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: A framework that promotes the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events.

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Also known as the Ports and Adapters pattern, this architecture focuses on separating the core logic from external systems.

- **Layered Architecture**: A traditional architecture style that separates concerns into layers, such as presentation, business logic, and data access.

- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: A pattern that separates read and write operations for better performance and scalability.

- **Serverless Architecture**: A cloud-computing model that allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers.

- **Orchestrator Core**: Manages the interactions between various microservices and coordinates the flow of data.

## Technologies Used

This repository utilizes a variety of technologies to implement the architectures:

- **.NET**: A robust framework for building applications.
- **Docker**: For containerization and easy deployment.
- **Kubernetes**: For orchestrating containerized applications.
- **RabbitMQ**: A message broker that facilitates communication between services.
- **Entity Framework**: An ORM for .NET that simplifies data access.
- **RESTful APIs**: For communication between client and server.
- **GraphQL**: An alternative to REST for APIs, allowing clients to request only the data they need.

## Getting Started

To get started with **dopArchitecton**, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/popalopaopa/dopArchitecton.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the directory where the repository is located.

   ```bash
   cd dopArchitecton
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Depending on the architecture you want to explore, make sure to install the necessary dependencies. Use the package manager relevant to your project (e.g., `dotnet restore` for .NET projects).

4. **Run the Application**: Follow the specific instructions in each architecture's folder to run the application.

## Usage

After setting up the repository, you can explore the different architectures. Each architecture folder contains documentation on how to run it and what technologies are used. 

For example, to run the Microservices architecture:

1. Navigate to the microservices folder:

   ```bash
   cd microservices
   ```

2. Start the services using Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Access the application through your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
